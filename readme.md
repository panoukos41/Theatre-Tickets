# Theatre-Tickets

This project has been developed within the course "Human-Machine Interaction" at [University of West Attica](https://uniwa.gr) department of [Industrial Design & Production Engineering.](https://idpe.uniwa.gr)  

The task was to create a site to purchase theatre tickets

The site was build using [Blazor](https://blazor.net), is published using github pages and its a Single Page Application.
It only works offline, the data is generated offline, once loaded there is no need for internet connection.

### Some things to consider!
> I made this app in a hurry so there are some hard-coded things for the "random generation" and some technical things that i could do better.  
> I will improve these things in the near future when blazor will be published!
